Other day I went to the cinema. I had plenty of time till the next train home. 
So I made up my mind to watch that new movie by Quentin Tarantino which was called „Django Unchained“. 
To be honest, I'm not a big fan of westerns, but I'm crazy about all the Tarantino's movies! 
So I just couldn't miss it! What's more, I had so much free time that I could watch even two movies!

When I came to the cinema it turned out they didn't have the tickets for „Django Unchained“. 
I was really upset. But it was not a surprise, because the cinema was so crowed and it was the premiere, 
so all the tickets had been bought away very quickly. So the only thing I could do was just to seat and 
wait for my train. I went to the nearest fast food and had a bite there.

For some reason I decided to come back to the cinema and ask them one more time about tickets for 
„Django Unchained“. Believe it or not, but they said that they really had the last ticket! 
The point was somebody had just returned his ticket, because he couldn't watch the movie in that time. 
I was so glad! So that day I managed to watch „Django Unchained“! The movie was great, I liked that! 
After it finished I came back to the Railway Station and went home!

I was lucky that day for sure!
